The show highlights how immature and narcissistic many of these people are and what they're willing to do to win a year of not having to be responsible for their own livelihoods. The criteria the cast uses to eliminate each other from the contest isn't made clear. The result is endless bickering and lots of catty, over-the-top dramatic confrontations. Meanwhile, despite the occasional reference to cast members wanting to grow up, there are no real life lessons being taught here about the work, sacrifice, and commitment it takes to do so."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "A bunch of uneducated, and irresponsible people in their 20's running around in an island is neither quality nor entertaining. Although, the premise of the show is attractive, spend one year of your life doing nothing and finding yourself. The idea is old, outdated and unimaginative. It would be more interesting if they were actually put in real life situations. Actually, it would be better if they were actually doing something constructive for society."; // Here goes the second review text.
