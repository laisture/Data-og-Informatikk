This show couldn't be better. I was even surprised by the great performance of Ashton Kutcher that I confess was not high on my list of good actors, but that surprised me integrating himself so perfectly to the plot and showing his own talent. I am amazed by how critical people are of this show, when you think deeply it is one of the best shows ever and giving no signs of getting old!"; // Here goes the second review text.
