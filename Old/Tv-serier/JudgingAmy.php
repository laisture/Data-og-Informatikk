You can watch it and it feels like real life ot is not fake and totally out there and leave you thinking that could and would never happen not this show. Thi show is completely real it shows a family that has there struggles and there problems and how they get through them although they might no always turn out good it is great.

All of the actors/actresses of the show are very excellent in playing their roles. I was sad when it got cancelled. I missed watching this series in the line of primetime shows and glad to know that I found a copy and purchased one at memorylanedvd .com . I received an absolutely amazing set! Complete episodes with great quality. Very satisfied with the order and definitely thankful to watch again a well-produced TV series of all time!"; // Here goes the second review text.
