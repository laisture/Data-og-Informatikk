	$review1 = "Very little shows prove how much cinema quality is needed on TV as this one. Many series mock movies, this IS a sort of long movie that gets better each episode. Season 1 of House of Cards is meant to watch at your own pace, falling in love with its incredible performances, rock-solid direction and sharp, incredible writing. Is a series that offers something different in terms of soapiness in comparison to other TV Shows. It is a smart Scorsesenian political satire, and is so damn entertaining and addictive you swear you will describe the show as an incredibly powerful drug.

	$review2 = "A dark and cynical take on Washington with an incredible score, first-rate production values, and excellent performances (particularly by the female cast). What keeps it from being better is that it is occasionally let down by heavy-handed and hammy dialogue and seriously hurt by a questionable turn in the 11th episode."; // Here goes the second review text.
