	$review1 = "I’m With Her is the story of celebrity actress Alex Young, who is the flavor of the month on the Hollywood scene. She meets down to earth schoolteacher Patrick Owen, and a budding relationship starts. Can a woman in the middle of the Hollywood glitz fall in love with a stable man in the real world? This is of course a true story. It’s based on the experiences of the writer, Chris Henchy, and his experiences dating Brooke Shields. This was a great little comedy show. It had just about everything you needed in a comedy. It had the embarrassing moments, crazy friends, and selfish family members. It was funny without going over the top. Teri Polo stars as Alex Young, and David Sutcliff is Patrick Owen."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "I'm With Her was a nice romantic comedy that deserved a better shot from ABC. Teri Polo and David Sutcliffe were appealing as the two leads, a famous movie star and the high school teacher with whom she falls in love. Unfortunately, the ABC brain trust decided to cancel I'm With Her and renew such drivel as George Lopez, My Wife and Kids, Hope and Faith, and According to Jim. I guess a show has to be bad and stupid to get renewed on that network. We'll never know how things worked out with Alex and Patrick but hopefully the two leads will go onto bigger and better things."; // Here goes the second review text.
