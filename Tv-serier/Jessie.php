	$review2 = "Out of all the current Disney shows JESSIE is the only one that entertains kids, teens and parents alike. In addition to great writing the overall setup of the show is refreshing for the Disney Channel. I am happy that Disney chose to star an actress who isn't 14, this is truly unique compared to every other series' typical setup. JESSIE is the MODERN FAMILY of the Disney Channel, using current story-lines and demonstrating non-traditional families. Although cultural puns are often made the result is a very family friendly warm "Disney" ending. Jessie and Zuri provide the best overall performances but they all have their moments."; // Here goes the second review text.
