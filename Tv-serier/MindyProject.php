	$review1 = "The Mindy Project, just like its main character, it's not without flaws. The characters are sometimes over the top, the situations occasionally unbelievable and some plots seem to serve only as a device for Mindy Kaling to pretend date a bunch of really hot men. However when the show is good, it's just really great. I love the chemistry between Mindy and Danny and the Christmas party episode made me root for them as a couple almost as much as I did for Nick and Jess mid second season of New Girl.
And from time to time we get served real gems like Chis Messina doing the Try Again dance routine (one of the funniest tv moments of 2013) that make me want to watch more and more."; // Here goes the first review text.

But whatever, that why I love coming to this page just to read the great comments left by other fans of the show. I may be getting ahead of myself, but I truly hope they get picked up for another season, if not 2 more! :)
Also, if you are as much of a fan of the character Morgan, I would suggest checking out The Morgan Project on youtube! You will not be sorry :)"; // Here goes the second review text.
