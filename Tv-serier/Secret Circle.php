Episode 4 introduces the concept of demons and spooky Heather's turn has given me renewed confidence that this show is going to get better and better. It's got its faults - Natasha Henstridge's face doesn't move; the concept, even down to a magical crystal mirrors the much loved Vampire Diaries; the boys aren't hot enough; and gran doesn't seem to care that a lamp gets broken every episode....BUT.... introducing demons could make it fun and Williamson's got form that cant be denied. A slow burn, perhaps!"; // Here goes the second review text.
