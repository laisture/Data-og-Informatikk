Well after watching a couple of episodes of this new series, I'm not too sure what to think. From what I can tell, when things are riding high, then its great, otherwise its kinda slow. But for now I'll assume the slower moving scenes are to set the stage upcoming drama."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "Gossip Girl is definitely my favorite new show this fall season. I'm a huge fan of the books, in fact, they are my favorite book series. The episodes have been great so far and I'm sure that the other ones will be jsut as good. The show is doing really well with keeping it like the books. A difference though is that it seems like Blair is meaner than the books. There are also a few things here and there that are different but I guess they have to make some changes. I look forward to watching my favorite new show every week!"; // Here goes the second review text.
