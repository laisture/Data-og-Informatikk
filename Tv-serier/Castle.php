As such the duo solve crimes in NYC while Beckett tries to keep Castle under control. This show is great. It has some great characters which have real chemistry between them. I only hope that this quality is kept up throughout the series and that the show stays on our screens.

	$review2 = "Finally we have a crime show which is light hearted and actually has a good sense of humour! after watching one episode you can tell, castle is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously. perfect for those who cant stand the typical melodramatic crime shows! where other tv series neglect the cases and focus to heavily on character relationships, castle has the perfect balance between the two. cases don't take the back seat as they are engaging and original week in, week out. the dynamic between castle and beckett is one of the best on tv, the banter they share always offers some good laughs. with Bones the 'will they won't they' aspect is repeatedly thrown in your face to the extent where it gets irritating, however with castle its much more subtle with the odd hint every now and then which actually adds more suspense and intensity. nathan fillion and stana katic have amazing chemistry that perfectly sells the whole thing."; // Here goes the second review text.
