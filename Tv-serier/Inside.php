I loved the show and it was paradoxically a breath of fresh air releasing many taboo things that occur and especially as shown through the main character that has been traumatized by similar abuses. Something that shows the truth, although through ficticious characters and events, shouldn't be kept quiet any longer. "; // Here goes the first review text.

Some people say it was a little dark, but I liked it this way.
I loved the characters and I think the cases were pretty good.
This wasn't all dark, we got our funny moments once is a while, specially with Danny and Melody.
There might be people there that don't share my opinion, but I always thought that Rebecca and Paul could've been a cute couple. "; // Here goes the second review text.
