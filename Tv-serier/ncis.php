	$review1 = "One thing I can say though is that it's the most underrated TV show ever. Because of its predecessor (JAG) and cousins (CSI, CSI: Miami, etc), at first glance people assume it's 'another spin-off series'. But it's so much more than that. So much more. Unlike the other typical crime/drama series, NCIS is not based solely on solving a crime. There's a tight-knit bunch of co-workers who work together in crime-fighting, but after understanding and getting to know each character, their personalities and habits, flaws and strong points, you begin to realise that it's not a crime show, it's a show that involves crime."; // Here goes the first review text.

This show lives up to the show it was spun-off of. I never miss an episode and I never will miss one."; // Here goes the second review text.
