So I'm not satisfied with that being the very last episode i just wish they would give us like 1 year from now or something or i don't know. but overall it left a good message.

	$review2 = "In the beginning of the series everything made sense. Ben was the good guy, Ricky wasn't and neither was Adrian. But once Ben had slept with Adrian and they almost had their own child everything changed. Amy and Ricky fell in love and were going to get married. In my opinion Amy is selfish. Sure I will agree one shouldn't marry one just because they have a child together, but Amy and Ricky were just so perfect together. But what gets me angry the most is Amy begged Ricky to get engaged when he felt they should of just waited. He then gives her what she wanted he couldn't even go to a college that was three hours away from where they live because AMY felt it was too far away. But now Amy goes to New York and leaves her child to stay with Ricky. The show gives the wrong message at the end Ann says John isn't a life sentence but I guess because Ann left her family to go to palm springs she can't judge Amy. The show should have ended differently it wasn't fair for Ricky the one who actually grew up"; // Here goes the second review text.
