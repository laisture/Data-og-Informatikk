I love the story developing between Haley and Nik. all thought I think he needs to relax just a tad, with all the screaming, and the choking, and the just plain crazy... but I can sorta respect his situation, being soo tough and so feared and so untrusting, yet afraid a tiny little baby and the life or in his case death changing responsibilities that will come along with it. Im so looking for to the protective role that he, Elijah and Bekka will be forced to play. "; // Here goes the first review text.

Vampire Diaries love triangle with Nina and the brothers is overrated and boring just stop it. FINALLY we get to see a show focused on family instead of love and women jumping from one bed to another after one date! I CAN'T WAIT FIR SEASON 2!"; // Here goes the second review text.
