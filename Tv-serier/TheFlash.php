And there's a whole weird mystery story arc going on that I'm very curious about. I'm also curious about who he's going to wind up, since there are two girls who could qualify as future love interests. Will it be the heartbroken one or the oblivious one?

	$review2 = "So I've only watched one episode as the second episode is airing today (or probably just finishing up now) but it's been good. I was a bit worried as the trailer for the show felt like I was watching the entire episode but thankfully it didn't reveal everything just mostly everything but not everything.

It was an interesting ending too. Thankfully I didn't see that it was spoiled before hand so I got to watch it fresh and I was amused and intrigued by all the ideas about Harrisson Wells. He could totally be . Wells seeing as he's only really ever called . so you never know. I could probably google this and settle this matter but where's the fun in that? Anyways, it's good so far. Nothing to write home about but it's better than I thought it was going to be so I guess that's something.
