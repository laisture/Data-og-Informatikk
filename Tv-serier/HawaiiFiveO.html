I lost track of how many moronic he-man face offs the pilot contained, and the number of ´good-guy breaks-the-rules´ cliches was mind-boggling. The networks need to learn a lesson from HBO and Showtime: original strong writing beats stupid formulas every time. This show wasted an hour of my life."; // Here goes the second review text.
