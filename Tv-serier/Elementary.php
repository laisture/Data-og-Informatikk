That being said, I love it. Miller is fantastic as Holmes and Liu is a wonderful lead actress who compliments the Holmes character well as Watson. The stories are enjoyable but a little bit predictable but still entertaining to watch.

I'd recommend it, It's a pretty good show and I don't see how people can hate it let alone give it a negative review."; // Here goes the first review text.

This new sherlock is like a sex deprived loser who spouts nonsensical verbal diareah. Whats next? Winnie the pooh reimagined as a crack dealer who bums tigger in a gimp suit.... stop making this crap."; // Here goes the second review text.
