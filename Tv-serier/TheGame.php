It's Ocean's Eleven without Vegas lights and all the smiles whose ace in the hole ends up being a lesson in how those who grow up with entitlement often have little or no idea of reality for a majority of people around the world and what happens when that reality is forced sharply onto one of those privileged few."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "The Game is a smart psychological thriller. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas and he receives an unusual
birthday present from his brother Conrad. Shortly after he sees him odd events start happening to him.
He doesn't know why the events are happening but apparently it's part of the game. To uncover the
object of the game defeats it's purpose. Overall a tightly wound thriller from the director of Fight Club,
David Fincher."; // Here goes the second review text.
