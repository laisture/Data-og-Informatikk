Imagination, quality writing, skillful acting (with a few exceptions), real suspense."; // Here goes the first review text.

It's utilized the horror associated with the virus to explore character histories and the mythology of Helix's world in general. The biggest pitfalls result from the archetypal characters. But a few of these characters are already being fleshed out. That said, it's been fun trying to unpack the source of the virus and the duplicitous intentions of several of the characters."; // Here goes the second review text.
