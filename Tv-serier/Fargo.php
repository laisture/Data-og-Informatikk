The amazing casting alone makes this show a success. A lot of the mainstream networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, TNT) fill their shows with actors who are bland model types - people who are just boring to watch. It's refreshing to find a show that casts interesting actors who aren't just cookie-cutter Ken and Barbie clones. The writing is great, but the interesting and likable actors really take this show to another level. It's great when you can tell the casting director wasn't trying to just fill all the roles with hot people, but rather trying to find people who were charismatic and believable in their roles."; // Here goes the first review text.
