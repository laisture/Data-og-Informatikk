Love the characters, especially their onscreen chemistry."; // Here goes the first review text.

I absolutely adore her and I don't know if I'd be able to continue to watch without her. Bo is good but the Duo is really what made this show spark for me. I await season 5 in 2015."; // Here goes the second review text.
