New people every week. Older characters dumped. It's very sad to me. I really wish that Daniel would get together with Jen! I find the whole show frustrating. I realize that you need younger viewers, but what thetlpeople who have been watching forever? I work full-time, so I usually have to catch up. I knew Sammy was leaving, but E J?

You guys really suck. You don't want to write the idiot woman out of the show. I have watched this show for 15 years and I am finished. If you can't write any better than this then I am finished watching this show."; // Here goes the second review text.
