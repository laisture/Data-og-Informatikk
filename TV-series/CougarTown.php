The whole point is that she is suppose to be dating younger guys and confident that she is older. Now she is dating this new guy Scott Foley and he is just as old as she is. They obsess about eating and that's why white girls are anorexic today. That episode about don't watch me eat was just ridiculous. Courtney Cox is so bony and frail. She just looks sick. They could have chosen someone else for the lead. Her best friend is also a mess. Anyone with eyes can tell that she injects her face with botox. This whole show is silly but mess like this will stay on the tv for years."; // Here goes the first review text.

I really hope this gets cancelled soon...for Courtney Cox's sake. She really does herself a disservice in this series"; // Here goes the second review text.
