When the first episodes began, I was interested and curious to find out what would happen, but after a while I got disappointed. The first episodes is nicely produced but it feels very boring. It would have been more interesting if they were put in real life situations. But if you really enjoy this kind of series you may want to give this a chance."; // Here goes the second review text.
