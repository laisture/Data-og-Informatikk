It's bad when your villain is stupid because it means that they're not really a villain at all, just a ticking time bomb, which is boring.
The other major issue with the season near the end is the total waste of Fig's situation. It would have been great to have her inducted into the very prison she terrorized for next season. But no. Despite all of the time spent on her this season, the show likely won't see her again.
The latter part of the season was only somewhat saved by the last ten minutes of the final episode. That was a really nice ending. But overall, season 2 paled in comparison to the first."; // Here goes the first review text.

Unlike season 1 where i loved everyone, season 2 started to get some annoying characters. Piper is getting less likeable.. And some changes in leaderships of the groups get annoying. But again super amazing ending to season 2!"; // Here goes the second review text.
