What made One Tree Hill so special was the fact that every episode unfolded part of the story and there was never a boring episode. At least until S6. After Chad & Hilarie left the show went downhill IMO especially in S8. I stopped watching after a while but this show still gave me amazing couples [Leyton/Naley] and the best friendships ever [Breyton/Laley/Paley]. I just missed how it used to be but it's still my favourite show."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "I absolutely loved this show from the beginning. It had good, interesting characters and storylines, and I found it be somewhat groundbreaking - having a school shooting, and killing such a popular main character in season 3. However, I felt it declined in recent years. And despite being a hardcore fan from the start, I found myself not being bothered if I missed an episode. It was full of soppy cliches and unrealistic. Particularly season 9. I wish it had ended sooner so that it could have ended on a high note and not have been dragged out until it was almost unwatchable. I also feel they could have had a bit more imagination when it came to naming their children, I find it hard to believe that they all wanted to name their children after the mothers maiden name."; // Here goes the second review text.
