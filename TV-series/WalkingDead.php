But season 2 is definitely a let down from 1. There needs to be more creepiness and zombie killing. This could easily be one of the best shows on TV if they'd just make it more creepy and add in some more action."; // Here goes the first review text.

This show is absolutely thrilling. It is definitely the best survival during a zombie Apocalypse i have ever seen or heard of. I love this show so much! It is definitely sensitive to some viewers, and i would not recommend it for young children it may give them nightmares. This show has one of the best story lines in all of TV. I don't know what i am going to do when they stop making the show, probably just watch them over and over again.
