There are elements of mystery and lots of clever plotting, and the series is not without heart. Have not enjoyed anything like this since 'Breaking Bad'. Cillian Murphy was simply born to play Thomas Shelby. I hope this series lives on for many a season. Give it a shot!"; // Here goes the second review text.
