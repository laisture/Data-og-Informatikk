	$review1 = "Let's begin with the Arrow. Stephen Amell is very impressive in the fight scenes and the the scenes showing him training is just a slap in the face of most of us of the male gender. That being said...his acting is very wooden. He has three or four stances with which he delivers duologue and no facial expressions at all. The show is still really entertaining. The plot and the action is as good as most action movies out there. The rest of the cast is OK but the characters are very one dimensional, maybe this is because of the source material or bad writing, i don't know, but it would be nice if the characters were more fleshed out. The origin story of Arrow and his escape from the prison island is actually the most entertaining. How he goes from spoiled rich kid to effective killing machine is handled very well in flashback, occasionally the episodes have to many back and forths from present to past and back again that the overall plot of the individual episode gets lost."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "During the first season I'll admit I found it rather unimpressive and strangely off putting to have a superhero kill off bad people. I made the right decision to stick with the show because it truly is one of the most brilliant comic book inspired shows ever. Despite not having superpowers like Clark Kent in Smallville, the action in Arrow is much more entertaining and riveting. The show has a pretty serious and dark feel to it, and keeps you guessing with every scene. The villains are surprisingly well developed as well. This show touches upon some romantic elements but doesn't make it a central theme. If you want true unadulterated superhero action and story this is the show for you. If you want to get into a new show, you can't go wrong with this one."; // Here goes the second review text.
