When I first heard the description, I was very sceptical about it, but after the first episode I was hooked. I own all three seasons and have watched every episode many times.
Veronica is a relatable, loveable character, as are the others in this show. Each season centres around a major crime that has taken place, and each episode is rich with witty dialogue and captivating plots which slowly untangle the major crime.
There has never been a show similar to it, and there never will be again."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "Acting and writing were 9+ and the storyline did well from going from a high school sleuth into a college one. Very great, and it was leading into having Veronica going into the FBI. A nice transitional show with great surprises and well, I don't know what else to say. If you haven't seen the series, do. Great stuff. There are rumors that they will make a movie...these rumors are what brought me here to do a review. Like another great show that was cancelled, firefly, I think a movie that will put a period on the end of an unfinished sentence would be wonderful. :D"; // Here goes the second review text.
