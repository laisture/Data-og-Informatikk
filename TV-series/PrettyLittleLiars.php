The show is so predictable because you know that there will be some twist, something suspenseful, and the girls will be in the same place they started the episode in. You already know that they won't solve the mystery of A until the series finale, yet there's always something to keep you there. The characters are all interesting, and they all have their own problems and secrets. Even the fashion is great- they're always wearing designer clothes. The show is one where you can't miss an episode because the plot is hard to follow if you don't know everything. Everything changes so quickly and it's hard to make a lasting guess at who the culprit is. Who murdered Alison, and who is A? They may never know. Definately a cant-miss show!"; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "Pretty Little Liars is a pretty good show that puts a new twist on the classic teen drama. With every turn there is a new mystery, making it so that this is okay for every single age group. I am so glad that they got the second half of season one, but I wish that it would have come sooner and I can't wait to find out who A is, but in these girls lives, it could be anyone, even their boyfriends, even their friends and even their parents. With all of this mystery, It is one of the best show on TV."; // Here goes the second review text.
