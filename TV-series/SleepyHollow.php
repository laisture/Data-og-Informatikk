	$review1 = "Lots to like here if this is your genre. Agree with what everyone else is saying fast -paced, good acting, nice cinematography. The over arching plot is interesting and has loads of potential to expand, though it does seem like a show where you have to watch to keep up with the mythology. There were a few clichÃ©d, annoying plot elements early in the pilot but thankfully they cleaned them up and moved on before the hour was up. And one super minor blooper, the real village of Sleepy Hollow has a population of 9870. For the series, they used the Village of Sleepy Hollow sign but changed the pop. to 144,000, which is a city, not a village."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "Can't wait for each episode. Was initially bummed because I thought each episode would only center on the deadly deeds of the horseman....but the trajectory of the series changed with the second episode. Love the vocal banter of the two leads, thankful for the metered way in which the backstory is revealed, and am already trying to figure out which characters in the police precinct are aware of what is going on in Sleepy Hollow. Thanks for not dragging out the storyline....which is why I stopped watching Once Upon A Time, Grimm (you've seen one, you've seen them all), and Lost. Good show FOX. I'm hooked."; // Here goes the second review text.
