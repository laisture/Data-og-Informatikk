	$review1 = "This is my favorite live-action TV show, period. The first season was great, the second season was fantastic, and it just kept getting better. The various actors that play The Doctor are all fantastic. Christopher Eccleston does a great job in the first season, David Tennant is phenomenal in seasons 2-4, and Matt Smith, although not as good as the first two Doctors, is also great in season 5 (I have yet to see season 6). The Doctor's female companions are also well-cast, from Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper, my favorite of the companions) to Donna Noble (played by Catherine Tate, who annoyed me at first but my opinion changed as the episodes went on) to Martha Jones (played by Freema Agyeman), to Amy Pond (played by Karen Gillan). It's so exciting; you never know where The Doctor will be next, or what horrors await him on the other side of time. A history of great actors, suspenseful writing, and great special effects. If you are a fan of Science Fiction at all, by any stretch, you owe it to yourself to watch this series. Even if you aren't, give it a go. You won't regret it"; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "As an American, British TV was irrelevant to me. That was until I stumbled on this masterpiece. About one year ago I discovered the TV show and soon watched every episode, eventually reaching Season 6, which I loved. If you are a fan of Sci-fi or just very intellectual story-telling, check this show out."; // Here goes the second review text.
