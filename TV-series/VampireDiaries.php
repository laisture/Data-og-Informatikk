			I have not read the books but have heard 	of them and love 	everything vampires and this show does not disappoint.
			Well cast, looks expensive, legit 'this is how teens talk' dialogue.
			This is the age old 	vampire story: dark brooding vampire meets young human girl. Kevin Williamson is able to balance
			the tension of the story with humor and irony. All of 	the characters are good looking and can deliver the snappy dialogue with ease.
			Even the cheesier elements (see: fog) don't take themselves too 	seriously. If you like true blood, twilight and loved buffy then you should
			all watch this show (mostly so that i can see the second episode!!)"; // Here goes the first review text.
