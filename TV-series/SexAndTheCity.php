For me the turning point for the show was when SJP's creative influence as (co)executive producer became more pronounced in the series run. By that I mean that the show became very Carrie-Away. in many respects. Also after a spell the product placement can get a little much.
The show was never meant to change the world, it was a hyper-stylized look at a group of single women in New York City. For that reason, I enjoyed the ride."; // Here goes the first review text.

	$review2 = "I always thought this show was stupid. I had never seen it before and I prejudged it. The very first episode I saw I became hooked. You get to follow these four women through their lives. Carrie is a column writer and she is in love with Mr. Big. They finally get together in the last episode. Miranda, who is high strong and finally realizes that Steve is the man she loves. Charlotte, a goody good who ends up with someone quite unexpected and gets her baby. And then there is Samantha, who just loves sex, and her friends. Each episode we get to learn something new about the women and who they are and what they want. Definitely for women. My mom and I love this show. I own all the seasons and the movie."; // Here goes the second review text.
