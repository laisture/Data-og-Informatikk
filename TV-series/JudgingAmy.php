This show has one of the best story lines in all of TV. I have never seen a poorly written or produced episode at all. The series is original and in my opinion it is flawless. The amazing casting makes this series a success and I will definitely keep watching this show for as long as it stays on. "; // Here goes the first review text.

It´s soo many talents out there. Find them instead of using characters like this. Have just wasted my time by watching this bad series. I couldn´t watch more than a few episodes, but that was enough. Who would waste your time watching this?"; // Here goes the second review text.
