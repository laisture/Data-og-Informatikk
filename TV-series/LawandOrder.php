I've never seen a poorly written or produced episode in all this time that it's been on the air, no not once. It seems that whenever some bizarre or unprecedented crime happens in real life...something that makes the news and stays there for weeks on end, you can almost expect the writers and producers of Law and Order to base one of their own shows on the general subject and do a slam-bang up job of it. This is the kind of show people remember for years after it's left the air."; // Here goes the second review text.
